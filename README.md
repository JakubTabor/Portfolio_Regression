# When we notice linear relationship pattern in our data we can use Linear model to generate predictions
* We can use this in so many cases np: behavior of the stock market, Sports Performance, business growth
* It can be use to examine the differences between features in data, because some kinds of data fits better than others.
* This type of examination is common in scientific tests e.g: role of statistics in clinical trial in the drug approval

# In my case I use Regression model to exploit correlation between some features in my data
* First I built correlation between features

# Then plot the most interestiong them on graph

* I was digging deeper and found unexpected pattern in my data (Correlation between Temperature and Salinity)

* I explore it with help of new parameter Density

# Then I use Linear Regression Model on my dataset to create predictions and all was fitting perfectly
