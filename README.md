# When we notice linear relationship pattern in our data we can use Linear model to generate predictions
* We can use this in so many cases np: behavior of the stock market, Sports Performance, business growth.
* This type of examination is common in scientific tests e.g: role of statistics in clinical trial in the drug approval

# In my case I use Regression model to exploit correlation between some features in my data

![]()

# Then plot the most interestiong them on graph

* I was digging deeper and found unexpected pattern in my data (Correlation between Temperature and Salinity)

![]()


* I explore it with help of new parameter Density

![]()

# Then I use Linear Regression Model on my dataset to create predictions and all was fitting perfectly
